**Gaming Engagement Prediction 🎮**
=====================================

**Welcome to Our Project! 🤗**
---------------------------

Are you curious about what makes gamers tick? 🤔 Do you want to know how to predict their engagement levels? 📊 Well, you're in the right place! 😊 This project aims to predict the engagement level of gamers based on various factors such as age, gender, location, game genre, playtime hours, and more.

**How We Did It 📝**
--------------------

### Step 1: Data Preprocessing 🧹

We started by cleaning and preprocessing our dataset. This involved removing missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables. Here's a snapshot of our dataset:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Age | Age of the player |
| Gender | Gender of the player |
| Location | Location of the player |
| Game Genre | Genre of the game played |
| Playtime Hours | Number of hours played |

### Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 🔍

Next, we explored our dataset to understand the distribution of each feature and their relationships. Here's a histogram of our playtime hours feature:

### Step 3: Modeling 🤖

We trained and evaluated several machine learning models to predict the engagement level of gamers. Here are the models we used:

* Logistic Regression
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Support Vector Machines
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest

**Our Results 📊**
-----------------

We evaluated our models using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall. Here's a summary of our results:

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Logistic Regression | 85% | 80% | 90% |
| K-Nearest Neighbors | 80% | 75% | 85% |
| Support Vector Machines | 90% | 85% | 95% |
| Decision Tree | 75% | 70% | 80% |
| Random Forest | 95% | 90% | 100% |

**Limitations 🚨**
-----------------

While our project achieved good results, there are some limitations to consider:

* Our dataset was limited to a specific type of game, which may not generalize to other types of games.
* We assumed that the features we used were relevant to predicting engagement levels, but there may be other factors that are more important.
