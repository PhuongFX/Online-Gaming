## Description 📝

> Analyzing online gaming behavior and predicting player engagement levels using machine learning.
> Enabling game developers to identify players at risk of churn and create personalized experiences to increase player satisfaction and loyalty.

## How it Works 🫶

  - Select the features that describe the player and the game.
  - Click the 'Predict' button to predict the engagement level of the player.
  - Get the predicted engagement level and use it to create personalized experiences for the player.

## Usage 🤗

  - Use the app to predict player engagement levels for note-taking, research, or content creation.
  - Detect phrases or keywords in player behavior for data analysis or market research.
  - Generate text from speech for speech-to-text applications, such as subtitles, closed captions, or voice assistants.
  - Use the app for language learning, by transcribing player behavior in a foreign language and practicing pronunciation.

## Features 🎉

1. Supports multiple features, including player characteristics, in-game behaviors, and game genre.
2. Uses a machine learning model to predict player engagement levels.
3. Displays the predicted engagement level in the app.
4. Allows you to copy and paste the predicted engagement level for further use.

1. Select the features that describe the player and the game 📝
2. Click the 'Predict' button 📊
3. Get the predicted engagement level 📈

**Dataset 📁**
-------------

The dataset used for this application is available on Kaggle:

* [Predict Online Gaming Behavior Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/predict-online-gaming-behavior-dataset) 📊

**Model 🤖**
------------

The model used for this application is a machine learning model trained on the dataset. The model predicts the engagement level of players based on their characteristics, in-game behaviors, and game genre.
