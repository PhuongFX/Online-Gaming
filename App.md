## How it Works 🫶

  - Select the features that describe the player and the game.
  - Click the 'Predict' button to predict the engagement level of the player.
  - Get the predicted engagement level and use it to create personalized experiences for the player.

## Usage 🤗

  - Use the app to predict player engagement levels for note-taking, research, or content creation.
  - Detect phrases or keywords in player behavior for data analysis or market research.
  - Generate text from speech for speech-to-text applications, such as subtitles, closed captions, or voice assistants.
  - Use the app for language learning, by transcribing player behavior in a foreign language and practicing pronunciation.

## Features 🎉

1. Supports multiple features, including player characteristics, in-game behaviors, and game genre.
2. Uses a machine learning model to predict player engagement levels.
